automatic integration of a function with a parameter two efficient methods for automatic numerical integration are romberg integration and adaptive simpson integration  for integrands of the form fxgx a where a is a parameter  it is shown that rombergs method is more efficient  a fortran program shows how to achieve this greater efficiency  cacm november  1966 rabinowitz  p

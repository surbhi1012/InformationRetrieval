half rotations in n-dimensional euclidean space an iterative procedure is described for determining half rotations in n-dimensional euclidean space  the method is a variant of the cyclic jacobi procedure and utilizers elementary plane rotations to obtain the half rotation matrix  numerical examples are given  cacm september  1966 mccamon  r  b

optimal starting approximations for generating square root for slow or no divide on machine with slow or no division  it is preferable to use an iterative scheme for the square root different from the classical heron scheme  the problem of optimal initial approximants is considered  and some optimal polynomial initial approximations are tabulated  cacm september  1970 wilson  m  w  square root  newton-raphson iteration  optimal approximants 5.13
